## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a simple, two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. In this project players can choose to enter their names or they can play anonymously, and the game will start with the first player. Players take turns marking a square with either an X or an O. The objective of the game is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw. There is also a reset button any time the player wants to restart the game.
